.NET 8 API using Container Apps, React frontend, token auth via Consolidator, and Azure services using Service Bus, Storage, ACR, I have created 5 main Test Plans.
Portal based API testing – Functional & Regression: It covers the .NET 8 backend.
Frontend Testing – UI & UX: It covers the React SPA talking to API through frontend. (E2E browser tests.)
Authentication & Authorization: Testing on token story with Consolidator + security trimming. (API-level and E2E tests)
Integration & Messaging: Test connections to microservices. (Integration Tests)
Non-Functional: Performance, Reliability & Security.
