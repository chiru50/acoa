Full traceability:
  a. Create test cases for:
critical API scenarios + Login
key user journeys
auth/security and performance acceptance criteria
   b. In Azure DevOps:
Associate automated tests (from your .NET / Playwright projects) to these test cases.
That way, when someone runs a test plan, they’re effectively triggering the corresponding         automated tests in the pipeline, and all results flow back into Test Plans.
